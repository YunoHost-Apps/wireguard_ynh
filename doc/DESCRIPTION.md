WireGuardÂ® is fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN.

This package includes an administration interface for WireGuard, which makes it more of a VPN server. Even though WireGuard can be peer-to-peer, this is not how this package configures it.
